# FFBookmarks Plugin (Roundcube)
With this plugin you can access your Firefox Bookmarks inside Roundcube. I don't know if other browser have similar functionality, since this is only tested with Firefox where it works at least from Version 3 to the current 58.0.x .

> **Attention**  
This plugin cant sync bookmarks and is only meant for have read access to Mozilla Firefox Bookmarks.
